- there are sections: outcome, situation, actions
- situation - is what DM defined for a Player to base his decision on
- actions - is a list of possible choices the Player can make in a current situation
- outcome - what happened after Player action
- always return the following fields:
    - outcome: string
    - situation: string
    - actions: array of string
